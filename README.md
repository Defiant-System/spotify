# Spotify
In order to run this application with ```defiant-cli``` you need to add valid values for ```client_id``` and ```client_secret``` in the file ```oauth-credentials.json```. You can obtain these values by registering an app at [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/). Create an account, if you don't already have one and after that, choose "Create an App" on your dashboard.

For obvious reasons, the credentials file is not stored in the repository and implicitly ignored via ```.gitignore```.
